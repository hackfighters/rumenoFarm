                    India is continuously growing in the Livestock Farming
                    sector and people are attracting towards commercial
                    livestock farming. Commercial Livestock farming means to run
                    an organized business for getting profit. In the commercial
                    business it is important to make a company and represent a
                    brand for all your products launched in the market. A
                    company needs to obtain all the important permissions,
                    registrations and licenses to run the business in the
                    market. Commercial rearing and farming keeps electronic
                    documentation of everything in a proper organized way and
                    needs software to keep all the records of the business.
